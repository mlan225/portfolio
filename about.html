			<h4>Hello!</h4>
			<p>My name is Marvin, and Iâ€™m a developer living within Lexington, KY.
				My programming experience stems from both my time working, and creating
				personal projects from home. The thing that really motivates me to program
				is the ability to take my ideas and bring them to life, without the
				boundaries and limitations of the physical world, and following this thought
				is what caused me to dive into an endless education of programming. Many
				unclosed divs, misspelled IDs, and git commits later, I ended up where I am
				today, for better or for worse.</p>

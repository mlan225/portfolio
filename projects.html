					A website I had begun working on for a friend of mine who had owned his own local contracting business and needed an internet solution for contacting customers that wasn't Facebook. The site was created using Jekyll and hosted on gh-pages. One of the main features of this site is the ability to implement Formspree functionality in able to send emails directly into a specified inbox.

					While this project originally started as an assignment for a web development class to test our ability to work with HTML and CSS, I decided to take it a couple steps further and take this opportunity to develop with Node.js. The website offers a functional non relational database and user authentication.

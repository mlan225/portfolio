				<br>
				<br> 
					A website I had begun working on for a friend of mine who had owned his own local contracting business and needed an internet solution for contacting customers that wasn't Facebook. The site was created using Jekyll and hosted on gh-pages. One of the main features of this site is the ability to implement Formspree functionality in able to send emails directly into a specified inbox.

				<br> 
					While this project originally started as an assignment for a web development class to test our ability to work with HTML and CSS, I decided to take it a couple steps further and take this opportunity to develop with Node.js. The website offers a functional non relational database and user authentication.

					The purpose of this site was for me to practice retrieving data using other website's APIs. It also went on to be used as my internship application task for Awesome inc. after I added the ability to make an account and favorite locations. While it was also created as a Node.js project like my other site, this one uses the Semantic UI framework instead of Bootstrap.

				<br>

					 This site was created with the purpose of surveying my fellow employees of the time on their opinions of Git as their primary version control software. The results were later used in a presentation over technical protocol. The forms are submitted to a Google Spreadsheet.

      <p>
        This project was a real short demonstration of programming as a tool in a real-world environment. Of course,
        websites themselves are useful resources in the grand scheme and depending on the features included, they can
        also provide some instant results. However, for me, this project was as much as a tool to me as a hammer or
        screwdriver at the time of its conception.

        The goal of this project is simply to record user answers and save them in an organized, readable format to a
        Google Sheet. This idea can prove as a helpful alternative to a full database depending on the situation.

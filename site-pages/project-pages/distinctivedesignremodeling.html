      <p>One of the several websites I've built alongside a fantastic team at eLink Design (you guys know who you are).
        Applying agile processes to the buildout of the website made both client communication and internal development
        simple and effective, which in the end, resulted in stunning websites.</p>

      <p>
        With my experience working on sites like these, I was able to greatly increase my abilities with UX design,
        allowing me to create solutions faster and spend more time developing projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my enhanced knowledge of UX, I had also gained a fair ammount of knowhow with Hosting by managing the domains of client sites and addressing their serverside issues.

        The Events Manager application is an internal program that I took part in 
        developing and continue to maintain at the University of Kentucky. Developed 
        with ASP.NET, the application leverages the advantages of a C# alongside the 
        Entity framework core ORM to manage data within a Microsoft SQL database.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The front end of the application is designed separately with Angular, providing 
        a dynamic single page experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Authentication for the application is handled through an implementation of 
        the Microsoft Identity Platform, limiting access to the app to only users 
        approved through the University's Active Directory.

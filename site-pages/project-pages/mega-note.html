      <p>MegaNote was intended to demonstrate my knowledge of ASP.NET webforms in C#. The application is a simple
        note-taking tool that will
        allow the user to record notes and save them for future use. There are several ideas I'd like to add in as
        features for this project when I can do so in the future.</p>
      <p>
        MegaNote makes use of a local database to run CRUD operations on its data and because of the local database
        running from an mdf file, this data will be separate from each device it has been installed on.
      </p>
      <p>
        To install the application, simply click the link below to begin your download. After unziping the downloaded
        zip file, launch the setup file to install MegaNote, where it will be available as an
        application on your computer. <strong>MegaNote is currently only available for Windows.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        To uninstall MegaNote, use your systems program uninstaller as you would a regular application and simply remove
        the folder containing the downloaded application files, application manifest, and setup files.

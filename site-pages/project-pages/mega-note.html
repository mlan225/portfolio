      <p>MegaNote was intended to demonstrate my knowledge of ASP.NET webforms in C#. The application is a simple
        note-taking tool that will
        allow the user to record notes and save them for future use. There are several ideas I'd like to add in as
        features for this project when I can do so in the future.</p>
      <p>
        MegaNote makes use of a local database to run CRUD operations on its data and because of the local database
        running from a .mdf file, this data will be separate from each device it has been installed on. Due to the
        use of the local database, the application will need to be run from Visual Studio.

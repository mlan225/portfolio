      <p>The Poll Buddy Discord bot was my first dive into Discord bot programming. Written in Javascript using the Node
        framework, the goal of this program is relatively simple, allowing the user to input unique command strings to
        have a customized poll formatted for them. Poll Buddy will pull from a large library of emoji's when assigning
        an emoji reaction to a poll option to keep things unique!
      </p>
      <p>
        While there is isn't any more I can see myself adding to further develop this specific program, I can see myself working on more bots in the future for the Discord community I am a part of.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is not currently live on a server, however, you can view the code on GitHub by following the link below!

      <p>I'd like to start by saying that while this project does not reflect my greatest design work on the front end,
        the backend is where this project shows.</p>
      <p>What started as a simple college assignment quickly turned to one of my first Node.js programs. Within the
        Rural Reviewer site, I demonstrate my knowledge of RESTful routing through the use of the CRUD operations. A
        user can Create, Read, Update, and Destroy viewable information on the site as well as sign in with an
        authenticated account.</p>

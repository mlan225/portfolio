      <h4>Node.Js | Javascript | Google API | JSON</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        This application is a tool to help keep track of the exchange rates presented on the Wallstreet Journal's site.
        The project was built within the Node.js framework and uses the Google API to record and reflect the JSON data
        on the WSJ website within an excel sheet. The JSON is received and formatted before sending it to the view using
        Javascript.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the WSJXR site, there is a link to view both the WSJ page with the original information and one to go
        straight to the google sheet. Any changes made in the google sheet will be overwritten upon loading the WSJXR
        site. This allows it to stay up to date and remove any edits previously made from other users that have run
        queries on the information.
      </p>
